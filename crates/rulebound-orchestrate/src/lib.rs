//!
//! Small enough to prove correct by exhaustion, which is how it is tested.

//!
//! Four rules, each a bug that already happened once (PLAN.md 0):
//!
//! 1. A gate may only ever subtract. There is no input to `reduce` that
//!    yields `Accept` other than a conjunction of passes, declared-off gates,
//!    and non-blocking warnings.
//! 2. `error` is a first-class outcome, never a `block` and never a `pass`.
//! 3. Unknown is an error.
//! 4. Acceptance never comes from a judgement.
