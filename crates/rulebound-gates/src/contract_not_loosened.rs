//! `contract_not_loosened` — did this diff weaken the contract without saying
//! why?
//!
//! This is the Goodhart defence, and it is the generalisation of `slop-gate`
//! decision 6. `slop-gate` audits the *other* tools' suppressions; this audits
//! *our own* configuration. A worker optimising against the gate suite rather
//! than against intent will not remove a requirement — it will set
//! `severity = "off"`, or add a name to `allow`, or delete the gate. All of
//! those are diff-visible, so all of them are checkable.
//!
//! What counts as a loosening, enumerated so the gate cannot quietly grow:
//!
//! | Change | Why it is a loosening |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | a gate deleted | the rule is gone |
//! | severity went down | `error` → `warn` is a rule that stopped blocking |
//! | a new `allow` entry | a documented exemption that is not documented |
//! | a new suppression | a silent exemption |
//! | a `not_covered` entry removed | the contract now claims *more* than before |
//! | severity raised to `error` with no `calibration` | an unmeasured claim promoted to blocking |
//!
//! The last row is the promotion guard, and it is the reason the analysis is
//! two-tree rather than a static check. Writing `severity = "error"` in a new
//! contract is an author making a claim; *promoting* a gate that was `warn` to
//! `error` in a diff is a claim that has to arrive with the measurement behind
//! it. A static rule would reject every contract until M5 exists, and would be
//! switched off before then.
//!
//! Every finding here is silenceable by a `[[change]]` record in the same
//! commit naming the gate and giving a non-blank reason. That is PRD 5: "A gate
//! may not be loosened without a reason in the same commit."
